    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://code-worrier.com/blog/kata/">my post</a> about the <a href="https://github.com/wbailey/kata">kata gem</a>, I promised to share something I learned from the <a href="https://github.com/wbailey/code_katas/blob/master/calculator.rb">calculator kata</a>.
Here goes.</p>

<p>The calculator kata asks you to construct a <code>Calculator</code> class the instances of which are initialized with comma-delimited strings of integers.
Next you are asked, one by one, to create a series of instance methods—<code>#sum</code>, <code>#prod</code>, <code>#div</code>, <code>#diff</code>—for the class that perform arithmetic operations on the stored integers.</p>

<p>Starting with <code>#sum</code> only, I wrote the class, obviously enough, like this:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>```ruby
  class Calculator</p>

<pre><code>def initialize expr
  @expr = expr
end

def sum
  @expr.split(/\,/).map(&amp;:to_i).inject(&amp;:+) || 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>After adding in another instance method, it made sense to move to conversion from string to array into the initialization method:</p>

<p>```ruby
  class Calculator</p>

<pre><code>def initialize expr
  @expr_array = expr.split(/\,/).map(&amp;:to_i)
end

def sum
  @expr_array.inject(&amp;:+) || 0
end

def prod
  @expr_array.inject(&amp;:*)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>I went on to add analogous subtraction and division methods, and then I started to get an itch:
Could I avoid writing "inject" four times?
More importantly, could I find a way that to write this class that reflected the underlying similarity in function shared by these four methods?</p>

<p>On a kata-fuelled lark, I decided to write the code I <em>wished</em> would work, even though I had no reason to think it would.
I passed the arithmetic operation symbols into the methods as arguments, and then into the inject blocks:</p>

<p>```ruby
  class Calculator</p>

<pre><code>def initialize expr
  @expr_array = expr.split(/\,/).map(&amp;:to_i)
end

def sum
  inject_op(:+) || 0
end

def prod
  inject_op(:*)
end

# etc.

private

def inject_op op
  @expr_array.inject(&amp; op)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
```</p>

<p>To my surprise <em>this actually does work</em>!!</p>

<p>My initial reaction was: Go Ruby!
And then: Thank you, kata.</p>

<p>But, finally, in the spirit of the aphorism that "magic is code you don't understand yet," I thought: How do these <code>&amp;</code> blocks work, anyway?
More on that in a later post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">code kata</a> is a small programming challenge on which a developer can practice her craft.
Kata have solutions in the sense that they set our requirements that a program can meet or fail to meet.
However, it is the process of thinking through the kata—and perhaps implementing it multiple times in different ways—that is intended to provoke learning.</p>

<p>Of course, you can't learn anything form a kata unless you <em>do</em> the kata.
Enter the <a href="https://github.com/wbailey/kata">kata gem</a> by <a href="http://exposinggotchas.blogspot.com/">Wes Bailey</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I learned about the gem from a lightning talk Bailey delivered at the inaugural <a href="http://steelcityrubyconf.org/">Steel City Ruby Conference</a> in Pittsburgh.
(Incidentally, SCRC was my first programming conference, and it was fantastic.
My experience there inspired this blog.)</p>

<p>The kata gem reduces the friction between you and actually sitting down to do kata.
It accomplishes this by presenting the kata requirements in bite-sized pieces on the command line.
The process of working through a kata via the gem resembles the work flow of test-driven development.
(To be clear, working with the gem in no way precludes <em>actual</em> TDD.)
This is no accident;
Bailey's <a href="https://github.com/wbailey/kata/wiki/Authoring-a-Kata">DSL</a> for authoring kata is modeled after the <a href="http://rspec.info/">Rspec</a> testing framework.</p>

<p>Here are the first two steps of the calculator kata, which asks the coder to create a <code>Calculator</code> class, instances of which are initialized with strings of numbers:</p>

<pre><code>Create a calculator that is initialized with a string expression
- detail: The expression is of the form digits separated by commas: "1,2"
- detail: The expression is accessed by a method named expr
- detail: The expression can be reset for evaluation at any time without re-initializing
- example: Calculator.new "1,2"

Add Method
  Create an add method that sums the string expression
  - detail: The method will return the sum of the digits
  - detail: The expression can contain 0, 1 or 2 numbers
  - detail: Then empty string will return 0
  - example: "" computes to 0
  - example: "1" computes to 1
  - example: "1,2" computes to 3
</code></pre>

<p>...and so on. Yes, things start off simply, but simple problems allow for focus on technique and experimentation.
In my <a href="http://code-worrier.com/blog/passing-symbols">next post</a>, I'll relate something I learned by experimenting with the calculator kata.</p>
