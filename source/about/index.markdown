Hi! I'm Michael Hoffman.
I'm a software developer at [Food52](http://food52.com/).

I started Code Worrier for two reasons: to learn through writing and getting feedback, and to engage more directly with the web development community.

So, please tell me what you think in the comments, or just [say hey on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hoffm).
If you want to know more about me, check out my [personal site](http://michaelshoffman.com/).
